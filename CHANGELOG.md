c4ae994 chore(todo): track equix multithread tasks — added an EquiX-focused TODO list (protocol docs, dedup, tests, bundle API, shared dispatcher), and extended .gitignore to cover *.zh.md and .cargo-local/ after encountering global registry permission issues; clippy/test run with CARGO_HOME overridden locally.
9113729 feat(equix): add streaming solver and shared dispatcher — split EquiX code into dedicated module (types/solver/bundle), added deduped parallel + streaming solvers that can emit bundles directly, enforced duplicate rejection in bundle verify, introduced shared NonceSource/HitStop used by EquiX/kpow/pow, documented seed/anti-replay guidance, and added concurrency/dedup property tests; TODOs checked off.
